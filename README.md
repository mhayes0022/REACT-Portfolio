# REACT-Portfolio

## Description

This application functions as a REACT portfolio of work samples. On the main page, there is an 'About Me' section with a short bio and a profile photo. Next, there is the 'Portfolio' page, which collects multiple examples of my recent work. Each Project includes a screenshot of the application, a short description, and both a link to the associated Github repository and a link to the deployed site. There is also a 'Resume' page, which has a summary of my resume. Lastly, there is the 'Contact' page, which includes a form to email me with further comments or questions about me or my work. At the very bottom of the site is a series of icons for Github, LinkedIn, and Stack-Overflow, all of which are functioning links to my profiles with the associated companies.

This application was built entirely by me, with some minor feedback from a tutor provided through the University of Minnesota for the purposes of a fullstack coding bootcamp.
